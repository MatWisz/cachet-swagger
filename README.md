# Cachet Swagger

## Overview

This swagger file attempts to recognize the current Cachet API.  Most of this has been done via the documentation as
well as going through certain endpoints and adding information.  The most frustrating portion of any developer is
working with an API where they do not follow the paths of documentation first and instead rely on manually typing this
information out.  This can be easily fixed with generation tooling and would easily and vastly make developers lives
easier.

## Usage

Using this swagger file works great with swagger-codegen to build out certain API endpoints.  We use this in general to
build out the (cachet-node)[https://github.com/mwillbanks/cachet-node] project.
